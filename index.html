				<li><b>1911</b> - Ho traveled to Saigon and obtained a job as a cook aboard a French steam ship bound
					for the French city of Marseille. Although the details of his journey are not well
					documented, Ho spent the next two years traveling around the world, visiting cities in
					Europe, Asia, North America, and, according to some accounts, Africa and South
				America as well. Ho eventually settled in London. </li>

				<li><b>1917</b> - Ho moved to Paris during the height of World War I. He adopted the name
					NGUYEN Ai Quoc (“Nguyen the Patriot”) and became involved in leftist and anticolonial
				activism. </li>

				<li><b>1919</b> - Ho worked to found the Association for Annamite Patriots, an organization composed
					of Vietnamese nationals living in France who opposed the French colonial occupation
					of Vietnam. He authored a petition demanding the end of the French colonial
					exploitation of Vietnam, which he attempted to present to the world powers at the
					Versailles Peace Conference held in the aftermath of World War I. His petition was
				never officially recognized, but his effort was well known in Vietnam. </li>

				<li><b>1920</b> - Ho became a founding member of the newly created French Communist Party. </li>

				<li><b>1922</b> - Ho founded the journal Le Paria (The Pariah), which served as a venue for anticolonial
					activists to express and disseminate their views about the French colonial
				regime. </li>

				<li><b>1923</b> - Ho traveled to Russia for the first time. After subsequent visits, he became
					acquainted with the most influential Soviet leaders including Nikolai BUKHARIN,
					Leon TROTSKY, and Joseph STALIN. While in Russia, Ho was trained as an agent
					of the Comintern*. He studied the thought of Marx and Lenin as well as
				organizational and revolutionary techniques. </li>

				<li><b>1923</b> - Ho traveled to China where he worked closely with Mikhail BORODIN, a fellow
					Comintern agent, to foment socialist revolution in China. While in China, Ho formed
					the Thanh Nien Cach Menh Dong Chi Hoi (“Revolutionary Youth League”), later
					known simply as Thanh Nien (“Youth”), an organization composed of Vietnamese
					exiles living in China and dedicated to revolution in Vietnam. As the Than Nien
					steadily grew in size, the organization began to establish connections with other
					Vietnamese nationalist and revolutionary groups residing in Vietnam. Thanh Nien
					also published the revolutionary journal Than Nien, which was secretly distributed
				throughout Southeast Asia. </li>
